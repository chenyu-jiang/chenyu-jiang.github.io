I am Chenyu Jiang (江宸宇), a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computing and Data Science at The University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Chuan Wu](https://i2.cs.hku.hk/~cwu/). I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2020. My research focuses on optimizing distributed LLM training systems. 

In my spare time, I like to take photos. You can find some of them [here](https://unsplash.com/@elistoo).
